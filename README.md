Alfred "Open with..." workflow
==============================

This is basically a shortcut to Alfred's "Open with..." command using a hotkey (or keyword) instead of navigating through Alfred's menu. Personally I use ^O (Ctrl+O)


Install
---

Download open-with.alfredworkflow and open the file using [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/).

P.S.: You need to [buy the Powerpack](https://buy.alfredapp.com/) to use this workflow.

Usage
---

Assign a hotkey, select a file on Finder, trigger this workflow and choose an app to open the file.

**Note for homebrew-cask users:**
Alfred's file filter doesn't recognize the aliases under ~/Applications/, that's why /opt/homebrew-cask-Caskroom/ is added.

This workflow is based on ["Open with Sublime Text 2"](https://github.com/franzheidl/alfred-workflows/tree/master/open-with-sublime-text-2) by Franz Heidl.
